Okay, I can help with that! Here's the initial simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Now, after reviewing the code, here's my feedback and improved version:

**Feedback:**

*   **Simplicity:** The code is already very simple and directly addresses the prompt.
*   **Clarity:**  Variable names are clear (`a`, `b`).
*   **Correctness:** The code performs the addition correctly.
*   **Testability**: It's easy to test this function.

**Improved Version (with explanation and slight enhancement):**

```javascript
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 *
 * @param {number} num1 The first number.
 * @param {number} num2 The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 * @throws {TypeError} If either input is not a number.
 */
function add(num1, num2) {
  if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
    throw new TypeError('Both arguments must be numbers.');
  }
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

*   **JSDoc Comments:** Added JSDoc comments to clearly document the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and potential errors.  This is good practice for maintainability and helps other developers (or your future self) understand the code quickly.
*   **Input Validation:**  Included a check to ensure that both inputs (`num1` and `num2`) are actually numbers.  If not, it throws a `TypeError` with a descriptive message. This makes the function more robust by preventing unexpected behavior if non-numeric values are passed in.  While the original prompt asked for a *simple* function, adding basic validation improves its reliability in real-world scenarios.
*   **Descriptive Parameter Names:** Changed `a` and `b` to `num1` and `num2` for better readability.  While `a` and `b` are common, more descriptive names enhance understanding.
*   **No unnecessary changes:** I avoided over-complicating the function. The core logic remains the same because it was already correct.

This improved version prioritizes code clarity, documentation, and robustness while keeping the function relatively simple and focused on its core purpose.  The added type checking is a valuable enhancement in most JavaScript development scenarios.
